#summary API definition to interact with Bicycle LED POV by communicating using USB

Bicycle LED POV is programmed with a PC software, using a USB connection. On PC will appear a new virtual serial port when connecting Bicycle LED POV.

Commands are sent to the virtual serial port to interact with Bicycle LED POV.

For each command sent, an answer with the value of the same command should be received - this works as a confirmation that command was received on Bicycle LED POV.

=Auto Scan Feature=
The firmware should have a auto scan feature for simplicity of usage to the end user.
The implementation of a byte being send in a determined time interval, say for example  400 ms. The value of the byte could be 0xFE.

This feature is needed for the PC software to find the hardware easily, therefore abstracting the user for knowing the port name, and speeding up the software speed at runtime.

=Dummy command: command 1=
This command do nothing. It's useful for knowing that firmware is answering by sending the same byte that it received (0x01)

Usage: 1. thismeans send to the hardware 0x01 


=Retrieve Bicycle LED POV firmware version: command 2=
This command returns the Bicycle LED POV firmware version.

Usage: 2 (send to the hardware 0x02);receive: _byte_1_; _byte_2_; _byte_3_
  * _byte_1_: major version number;
  * _byte_2_: minor version number;
  * _byte_3_: revision version number.

Example: Version 1.0.2

=Test LEDs: command 3=
This command is useful to test the LEDs hardware, by turning them on and off.

Usage: "3" send 0x03 and then the test led number; _byte_1_; _byte_2_; _byte_3_; _byte_4_; _byte_5_; _byte_6_; _byte_7_; _byte_8_

_Byte_x_ bits represents each state of LEDs - bit 0 of _byte_1_ represents the state of the first LED.

=Test sensor hall effect: command 4=
This command is useful to test the sensor hall effect, by turning on and off the first LED when sensor hall effect state is on and off respectively.

Usage: "4" send 0x04 and then 0x01 for Test ON or 0x00 for test OFF; _byte_1_

_byte_1_ with value 1 to turn on the test and with value 0 to turn off the test.

=Read byte from external EEPROM memory: command 5=
send 0x05

=Write byte to external EEPROM memory: command 6=
send 0x06

=Read image from external EEPROM memory: command 7=
send 0x07

=Write image to external EEPROM memory: command 8=
send 0x08
