#summary Description of tools used to develop and hack Bicycle LED POV.

One of the objectives of the project is to use only Free Software tools as possible, since this is a community project does not make sense to share information and use proprietary tools, we want that everyone can use this tools, be able to freely hack Bicycle LED POV. 		 

=Schematic and PCB design= 		 
There are at least two good candidates, [http://geda.seul.org/index.html gEDA] and [http://kicad.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php/Main_Page KiCad] - both are availably in GNU/Linux Ubuntu repositories. 		 

=Program the MCU= 		 
The AT90USB162 MCU comes from Atmel with a USB boot loader, it can be programmed by USB. On GNU/Linux the [http://dfu-programmer.sourceforge.net/ dfu-programmer] can be used to program the MCU by USB - dfu-programmer is available on Gnu/Linux Ubuntu repositories. 		 

Here is an screenshot after programming using the dfu-programmer:

Another way to program the MCU, change it fuses, etc, is using the [http://www.embedded-projects.net/index.php?page_id=165 USBProg] working as AVRISPMK2 clone. 		 

=Firmware= 		 
==C compiler== 		 
The C compiler is the [http://www.avrfreaks.net/wiki/index.php/Documentation:AVR_GCC AVR-GCC], which is stimulated from Atmel. 		 

One of the main reasons to use the Atmel MCUs is because there are very good tools as the AVR-GCC and AVR-LibC freely - both are availably in GNU/Linux Ubuntu repositories. Also Atmel provides good documentation, good example codes and a strong community. 		 
==USB Library== 		 
After reading about [http://www.atmel.com/dyn/resources/prod_documents/AVR_USB_Software.htm Atmel USB Software Library for AT90USBxxx Microcontrollers], was decided to use instead the [http://www.fourwalledcubicle.com/MyUSB.php Dean Camera's MyUSB library] because have better documentation and example applications. 		 
==IDE== 		 
I use Anjuta or Quanta Plus, however, any text editor should be ok. 		 

=Software= 		 

Here I will let a list of software dev tools that I use. Maybe they aren't the best for everyone, but for me is with what I work. All OPEN SOURCE!
