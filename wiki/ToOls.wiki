#summary Description of tools used to develop and hack Bicycle LED POV.

One of the objectives of the project is to use only [http://www.fsf.org/ Free Software] tools as possible, since this is a community project does not make sense to share information and use proprietary tools, we want that everyone can use this tools, be able to freely hack Bicycle LED POV. 	

=SVN=
  * [http://pysvn.tigris.org/ pysvn WorkBench] - works at least in GNU/Linux and Windows.
  * [http://rapidsvn.tigris.org/ RapidSVN] - works at least in GNU/Linux and Windows. Available on GNU/Linux repositories.

=Schematic and PCB design= 		 
There are at least two good candidates, [http://geda.seul.org/index.html gEDA] and [http://kicad.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php/Main_Page KiCAD] - both are availably in GNU/Linux Ubuntu repositories.

We are using [http://kicad.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php/Main_Page KiCAD].

=Program the MCU= 		 
The AT90USB162 MCU comes from Atmel with a USB boot loader, it can be programmed by USB. On GNU/Linux the [http://dfu-programmer.sourceforge.net/ dfu-programmer] can be used to program the MCU by USB - dfu-programmer is available on Gnu/Linux Ubuntu repositories. 		 

Here is an screenshot after programming using the dfu-programmer:

Another way to program the MCU, change it fuses, etc, is using the [http://www.embedded-projects.net/index.php?page_id=165 USBProg] working as AVRISPMK2 clone. This should not be needed, using USB bootloader is simpler.

=Firmware= 		 
==C compiler== 		 
The C compiler is the [http://www.avrfreaks.net/wiki/index.php/Documentation:AVR_GCC AVR-GCC], which is stimulated from Atmel. 		 

One of the main reasons to use the Atmel MCUs is because there are very good tools as the AVR-GCC and AVR-LibC freely - both are availably in GNU/Linux Ubuntu repositories. Also Atmel provides good documentation, good example codes and a strong community. 		 
==USB Library== 		 
After reading about [http://www.atmel.com/dyn/resources/prod_documents/AVR_USB_Software.htm Atmel USB Software Library for AT90USBxxx Microcontrollers], was decided to use instead the [http://www.fourwalledcubicle.com/MyUSB.php Dean Camera's MyUSB library] because have better documentation and example applications. 		 
==IDE== 		 
JpCasainho uses Anjuta or Quanta Plus, however, any text editor should be ok.
