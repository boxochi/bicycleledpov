*Changes on hardware*

There is some relevant changes on hardware - we have changed from using an EEPROM memory to a DataFlash memory. For almost the same cost we can have a memory that holds 32 times more data.

We will be using an 8Mb, the cheapest DataFlash memory available - the [http://pt.farnell.com/1455015/semiconductors-integrated-circuits/product.us0?sku=atmel-at26df081a-su AT26DF081A-SU for 1,42€]. With this 8Mb we should be able to hold about 1000 images!!

This DataFlash have the same physical size of EEPROM memory and also the same connections. Energy used is also almost the same, ~15mA when writing data. Also working with it on FiRmware is almost the same, it have some new good features.

Only one question, this memory works between 2,7 to 3,6 volts Vcc - we decided to change DC-DC to work for 3,3 volts instead of 5 volts. I didn't test it yet on protype, but it should work.

MCU now runs with Vcc 3,3 volts which means that will not be able to run at 16MHz, just at 8MHz.

*PCB and Part list*

Since schematic is stable now, we started working on Part list and PCB. We hope to have a working V1.0 hardware in next 3 weeks.

In the last days I tested 3 different ICs for DC-DC circuits. See the tests results with oscilloscope images on page TestsToDcDcCircuitsAndIcs.

Schematic is done :-) To get the full schematic, visit the HaRdware page. Here is a preview:

===News from DonaldZiems:==
Well, I goofed.  I needed to upload something, but not thinking, I used my Windows machine, which apparently uses Subversion 1.5, and automatically upgraded the subversion data to 1.5, which is incompatible with 1.4 (which is what Ubuntu uses in their repositories)  I'm working on downgrading it currently, so hopefully all will be well shortly.

Update:
Turns out, I can read using subversion 1.4.6 on my Hardy Heron computer, but not using subversion 1.4.4 on my Gutsy Gibbon computer.  Still working on a fix.

Update:
Should be all fixed now.

===News from RicardoLameiro:==
Today I added Some info about software development to the ToOls page and also for the SVN management.

Added also one more function to the Firmware API - the Auto Scan feature.

I made also some improvements to the script/software aimed to improve the cross platform ability, not yet fully tested. Also implemented the dummy command and the firmware version command but they are untested in real hardware :) so maybe it is not working. 

The GUI suffered a major redesign since the last screenshot :). The animation/picture design is stopped, and it will be the most difficult part for me... still thinking how to do it, if anyone with python knowledge and GUI toolkits master knowledge is welcome to help. At this moment the GUI toolkit used is Tk, but I think that wxPython will be better for this purpose. Will see...

I added some comments to the code to improve the readability of the code, it is still ugly but readable (python rocks!!).

Over and out.

===News from DonaldZiems:===

Alright, finally started making some updates to the schematic.

First and foremost, I split it into 3 sheets, one for the microcontroller, one for the EEPROM and sensor, and one for the LEDs.

Second, I linked all three sheets into a single hierarchy so that data paths from one sheet to another will function when we go to design the PCB.

[http://bicycleledpov.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/Pictures/20080625-BicycleLEDPOV-schematic.jpg]

Third, the schematic sheet with the LEDs and shift registers should be complete.




===News from RicardoLameiro:===

Well, the software to send commands and control the serial port is in development, for now I have a screenshot of a GUI (Graphic User Interface) to the software. I am doing the GUI in Tkinter toolkit, that is built in in python.

[http://bicycleledpov.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/Pictures/20080625-BicycleLEDPOV-software.png]

Explanation:
to the left will be two listbox. the upper right will contain the available serial ports
in the bottom left a list of possible commands. to the upper right a scan button to search for serial ports, and to the bottom right a send command button. Prety straight forward I think. Please leave comments in the mailing list.

*LED's + serial data latches working*

I wrote 2 new pages: SystemClockAndClockOptionsOnAT90USB162 and LeDs.

I had done a lot of code on FiRmware and I have now the LED's + the serial data latches working, here is 2 images showing that:

This image show my Asus EEE PC with GNU/Linux Ubuntu running Cutecom, a program to send information by serial port. Development board is connected to PC by USB cable, I did used the _Test LEDs: command 3_ from FirmwareApi to turn on that LED's -- I did control the LED's using the PC. There are 2 AAA NiMh batteries under the board of the LED's, which give energy to LED's.

Today I tried to program the bootloader but I couldn't because I had problems on programing cable, I will try again later. While doing this I discovered that the bootloder is working, I didn't erase It.
I also did read on datasheet that MCU comes configured on fuses to run at Clock/8, so It's running at 1MHz and not at 8 MHz as I was expecting.

While investigating why the cable used to program didn't work, I took some pictures of USB data lines using the oscilosce, here is one from D- data line:

[http://bicycleledpov.googlecode.com/svn-history/r41/trunk/Pictures/20080609-USB_D_minus_line-02.jpg]

This was my first time that I say wave forms from USB data lines.

I did wired the sensor hall effect and made code to test it :-) - the FirmwareApi _Dummy command: command 1_ and _Test sensor hall effect: command 4_ is working correctly now. The code is on SVN.

I divided the code in parts: the task "PCLink_Task" and 
the "MakePOV_Task".

PCLink_task starts automatically running when USB is connected while 
MakePOV_Task stop running -- on this time we can communicate with the 
hardware to download images on SPI EEPROM and test hardware.

When we disconnect USB, PCLink_Task automatically stop and MakePOV_Task starts 
running, where it should take data from EEPROM and send to LED's, making the 
POV :-)

Here is one picture of the development board + sensor hall effect:

[http://bicycleledpov.googlecode.com/svn-history/r41/trunk/Pictures/20080610-BicycleLEDPOV-prototype-600x.jpg]

I uploaded the first firmware version to SVN server, it can be accessed [http://code.google.com/p/bicycleledpov/source/browse/trunk/BicycleLEDPOV here].

I can't program now the MCU using the dfu-programmer, maybe I erased the bootloader... next Monday I will try to program the bootloader using USBProg. I will try to use the bootloader written by Dean Camera.

In next days I would like to start writing and reading data to SPI EEPROM.

I tested today two different sensor hall effects, the SS411A and the A3213ELHLT-T. The SS411A turns on with one pole and turns off with other pole from the magnet. The A3213ELHLT-T turns on and off with any pole from the magnet.

With the same magnet, I did measure the distance needed to turn on/off of each sensor: SS411A -> 1,8 cm and A3213ELHLT-T -> 1,5 cm.

I also tried the DC-DC IC NCP1450ASN30T1G which have 3 volts fixed output voltage. It worked well, I don't know why the NCP1450ASN50T1G (5 volts version) didn't worked to me last time.
Now I would like to find a DC-DC IC with embedded switches (the transistor + diode), to have a simpler circuit - probably I will use the [http://www.ladyada.net/make/mintyboost/ Minty Boost].

Atmel gives a free code and explains how to make a USB<->RS232 with that MCU. I think that is possible to use AT90USB162 for USB communication between PC + read data from SPI EEPROM and drive LEDs with image frames :-) -- so this project will be just that ;-) :-)

Also the AT90USB162 comes from Atmel with an USB bootloader that permits program the device by simple connecting It to PC by USB cable!! Nice, easy for development and hacking and all with development tools availabe for GNU/Linux, with full source code :-)
