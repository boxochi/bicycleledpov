Sensor hall effect ??

Linear Low Drop Out voltage regulator ??
- We can use 3 AAA NiMh cells where we will get about 1,2*3 = 3,6 volts. We can use a LDO regulator which is cheap and will power on the ARM7 and DataFlash memory at about 3,3 volts.

LED
We may use 5mm discrete LED. We will control the current of the LED with a series resistor. Energy for the LED will come directly from the batteries.

==PCB==
