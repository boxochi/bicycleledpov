Today I tried to program the bootloader but I couldn't because I had problems on programing cable, I will try again later. While doing this I discovered that the bootloder is working, I didn't erase It.
I also did read on datasheet that MCU comes configured on fuses to run at Clock/8, so It's running at 1MHz and not at 8 MHz as I was expecting.

While investigating why the cable used to program didn't work, I took some pictures of USB data lines using the oscilosce, here is one from D- data line:

[http://bicycleledpov.googlecode.com/svn-history/r41/trunk/BicycleLEDPOV/Pictures/20080609-USB_D_minus_line-02.jpg]

This was my first time that I say wave forms from USB data lines. Other pictures can be seen here.

I did wired the sensor hall effect and made code to test it :-) - the FirmwareApi _Dummy command: command 1_ and _Test sensor hall effect: command 4_ is working correctly now. The code is on SVN.

I divided the code in parts: the task "PCLink_Task" and 
the "MakePOV_Task".

PCLink_task starts automatically running when USB is connected while 
MakePOV_Task stop running -- on this time we can communicate with the 
hardware to download images on SPI EEPROM and test hardware.

When we disconnect USB, PCLink_Task automatically stop and MakePOV_Task starts 
running, where it should take data from EEPROM and send to LED's, making the 
POV :-)

Here is one picture of the development board + sensor hall effect:

I took some pictures and add them [http://code.google.com/p/bicycleledpov/source/browse/trunk/BicycleLEDPOV/Pictures/ here] on SVN.

I was trying to build DFU bootloader code from Dean Camera without success, luckily I did used the [http://www.avrfreaks.net/index.php?name=PNphpBB2&file=viewtopic&t=64923&start=0&postdays=0&postorder=asc&highlight= AVRFreaks forum and asked for help], the problem is now resolved and I did commit the changes. I am not really sure the bootloader is working since I have some questions yet and I didn't flash it - just tomorrow.

I started thinking on MemoryOrganization and on FirmwareApi. I also asked help to [http://code.google.com/u/dziems/ Donald Ziems] for selling me a SPI EEPROM memory, I don't have any as is much expensive for me to buy only that IC from Farnell - I should buy at least 40€ + VAT from Farnell.

==2008.06.07==
I uploaded the first firmware version to SVN server, it can be accessed [http://code.google.com/p/bicycleledpov/source/browse/trunk/BicycleLEDPOV here].

I can't program now the MCU using the dfu-programmer, maybe I erased the bootloader... next Monday I will try to program the bootloader using USBProg. I will try to use the bootloader written by Dean Camera.

In next days I would like to start writing and reading data to SPI EEPROM.

I received today my [http://www.olimex.com/dev/avr-usb-162.html AVR-USB-162 development board from Olimex] and I did a few hacks in USBtoSerial program from [http://www.fourwalledcubicle.com/MyUSB.php MyUSB library] and I got it working, but turning on the LED when I send value "1" to serial port and off the LED when I send "0" - It also send back to serial port the same vale sent before. Here some images (from GNU/Linux Ubuntu on my Asus eee pc 701):

It were very quick to install and use the [http://dfu-programmer.sourceforge.net/ dfu-programmer] and [http://www.nongnu.org/avr-libc/ avr-gcc] on GNU/Linux Ubuntu!!

I tested today two different sensor hall effects, the SS411A and the A3213ELHLT-T. The SS411A turns on with one pole and turns off with other pole from the magnet. The A3213ELHLT-T turns on and off with any pole from the magnet.

With the same magnet, I did measure the distance needed to turn on/off of each sensor: SS411A -> 1,8 cm and A3213ELHLT-T -> 1,5 cm.

I also tried the DC-DC IC NCP1450ASN30T1G which have 3 volts fixed output voltage. It worked well, I don't know why the NCP1450ASN50T1G (5 volts version) didn't worked to me last time.
Now I would like to find a DC-DC IC with embedded switches (the transistor + diode), to have a simpler circuit - probably I will use the [http://www.ladyada.net/make/mintyboost/ Minty Boost].

Today I received the DC-DC IC NCP1450ASN50T1G and I couldn't put It working :-( - I had low voltage output and with a lot of noise... I saw on oscilloscope the PWM output and the inductor signal going to ground... I saw that the DC-DC was in noncontinuous mode and I did put a larger load and saw It going to active region, with duty-cycle of PWM near to 50%.

I also received the sensor hall effect, I will test it in the next days.
My [http://www.olimex.com/dev/avr-usb-162.html AVR-USB-162 development board from Olimex] is on the road, I hope to receive it in a week or so.

Since yesterday I did read the [http://www.fourwalledcubicle.com/MyUSB.php MyUSB library for USB-enabled AVR microcontrollers] which I will prefer over _Atmel USB Software Library for AT90USBxxx Microcontrollers_.

I did build the Demo of the _USBtoSerial_ of _MyUSB_ library. Will be very easy to receive and send data to the serial port on the PC - _MyUSB_ library code is easy to understand, thanks [http://www.fourwalledcubicle.com/ Dean Camera]!!

I decided to buy the ~25€[http://www.olimex.com/dev/avr-usb-162.html AVR-USB-162 development board from Olimex], since I bought recently a development board from Olimex for about 200€ and I am happy with the service.

==2008.05.24==
I started yesterday reading about the Atmel MCU AT90USB162, It's cheap and can be bought on one unit on Farnell. I also find a cheap [http://www.olimex.com/dev/avr-usb-162.html development board from Olimex] - ~25€:

[http://www.olimex.com/dev/images/AVR/AVR-USB-162-2.jpg]

Atmel gives a free code and explains how to make a USB<->RS232 with that MCU. I think that is possible to use AT90USB162 for USB communication between PC + read data from SPI EEPROM and drive LEDs with image frames :-) -- so this project will be just that ;-) :-)

Also the AT90USB162 comes from Atmel with an USB bootloader that permits program the device by simple connecting It to PC by USB cable!! Nice, easy for development and hacking and all with development tools availabe for GNU/Linux, with full source code :-)
