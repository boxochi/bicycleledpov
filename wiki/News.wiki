Since yesterday I did read the [http://www.fourwalledcubicle.com/wiki/Wikka/MyUSB MyUSB library for USB-enabled AVR microcontrollers] which I will prefer over _Atmel USB Software Library for AT90USBxxx Microcontrollers_.

I did build the Demo of the _USBtoSerial_ of _MyUSB_ library. Will be very easy to receive and send data to the serial port on the PC - _MyUSB_ library code is easy to understand, thanks [http://www.fourwalledcubicle.com/ Dean Camera]!!

I decided to buy the ~25€[http://www.olimex.com/dev/avr-usb-162.html AVR-USB-162 development board from Olimex], since I bought recently a development board from Olimex for about 200€ and I am happy with the service.

I started yesterday reading about the Atmel MCU AT90USB162, It's cheap and can be bought on one unit on Farnell. I also find a cheap [http://www.olimex.com/dev/avr-usb-162.html development board from Olimex] - ~25€:

Atmel gives a free code and explains how to make a USB<->RS232 with that MCU. I think that is possible to use AT90USB162 for USB communication between PC + read data from SPI EEPROM and drive LEDs with image frames :-) -- so this project will be just that ;-) :-)

Also the AT90USB162 comes from Atmel with an USB bootloader that permits program the device by simple connecting It to PC by USB cable!! Nice, easy for development and hacking and all with development tools availabe for GNU/Linux, with full source code :-)
