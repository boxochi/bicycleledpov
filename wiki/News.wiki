I started yesterday reading about the Atmel MCU AT90USB162, It's cheap and can be bought on one unit on Farnell. I also find a cheap [http://www.olimex.com/dev/avr-usb-162.html development board from Olimex] - ~25 euros:

Atmel gives a free code and explains how to make a USB<->RS232 with that MCU. I think that is possible to use AT90USB162 for USB communication between PC + read data from SPI EEPROM and drive LEDs with image frames :-) -- so this project will be just that ;-) :-)

Also the AT90USB162 comes from Atmel with an USB bootloader that permits program the device by simple connecting It to PC by USB cable!! Nice, easy for development and hacking and all with development tools availabe for GNU/Linux, with full source code :-)
