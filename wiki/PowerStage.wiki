=Power calculations=
==Vcc +5V==
The IC's that will be supplied with 5 volts are the MCU, the sensor hall effect and the serial EEPROM memory.

I estimate no more than 15mA for MCU, 5mA for sensor hall effect and 8mA for serial EEPROM memory -- total of 28mA. The DC-DC should be dimensioned for this 28mA.

==Vcc +2.4V==
LEDs will be drived with this voltage but with a resistor in series.

=Development and testing of a DC-DC converter=
On date 2 of July of 2008, JpCasainho assembled a DC-DC converter that boots his 2,4 volts at input to 5 volts at his output, with at least 100mA of current at output.

The idea is to power with 5 volts the MCU, EEPROM memory and sensor hall effect, using just two `NiMh` cells in series - 2,4 volts.

Here is the DC-DC circuit at testing - high quality version [http://bicycleledpov.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/BicycleLEDPOV/Pictures/20080702-hardware-dc_dc.jpg here]:

The DC-DC circuit is composed of MAX756 IC, a SGL1-40 schottky diode, a [http://uk.farnell.com/1463486/passives/product.us0?sku=bourns-sdr0805-100ml&_requestid=151361 coil of 10uH], two capacitors of 47uF-16V for Cin and Cout and one capacitor of 100nF.

Two tests were made, using a RL of 100K and 47R to get ~50uA and 100mA respectively.

Here are the results on oscilloscope, with RL = 100k - channel 1 on Vout and channel 2 on positive side of schottky diode:
