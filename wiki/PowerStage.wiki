=Power calculations=
==Vcc +5V==
The IC's that will be supplied with 5 volts are the MCU, the sensor hall effect and the serial EEPROM memory.

I estimate no more than 15mA for MCU, 5mA for sensor hall effect and 8mA for serial EEPROM memory -- total of 28mA. The DC-DC should be dimensioned for this 28mA.

==Vcc +2.4V==
LEDs will be drived with this voltage but with a resistor in series.





=Development and testing of a DC-DC converter=
On date 2 of July of 2008, JpCasainho assembled a DC-DC converter that uses 2,4 volts for Vin and outputs 5 volts with at least 100mA.

The idea is to power with 5 volts the control circuit that uses the MCU, EEPROM memory and sensor hall effect, with just two NiMh cells in series (2,4 volts).

Here is the DC-DC circuit at testing:

And here is the result on oscilloscope, with RL = 100k:
