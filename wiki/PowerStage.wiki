This is the power stage, with 2,4 volts input from two 1,2 volts NiMh rechargeable batteries in series.

Output is 2,4 volts for LEDs and 5 volts for MCU and others ICs as the serial SPI EEPROM.

I will soon test this schematic - R1 is for having 200mA output current, to simulate the final load of the circuit on the 5 volts line.
