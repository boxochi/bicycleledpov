=Power sources=
==+BATT==
HaRdware uses 2 AAA `NiMh` cells or alkaline cells.

Assuming the use of `NiMh` cells, +2,4 volts are available for drive LEDs.

Current used by LEDs can be from about 0,5 A to about 1,3 A.

==Vcc +5V==
MCU needs at least +3,3 volts to have USB peripheral working. Was decided to use an DC-DC circuit to elevate the +BATT voltage to +5 volts. With +5 volts, MCU can run at his maximum speed of 16MHz.

EEPROM memory and sensor hall effect are also sourced with +5 volts.

Current used by MCU, EEPROM memory and sensor hall effect, should be less than 35 mA.

=Development and testing of a DC-DC converter=
On date 2 of July of 2008, JpCasainho assembled a DC-DC converter that boots his +2,4 volts at input to +5 volts at his output, with at least 100mA of current at output. JpCasainho had as reference the [http://www.ladyada.net/make/mintyboost/ Minty Boost] circuit.

Here is the DC-DC circuit at testing - high quality version [http://bicycleledpov.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/BicycleLEDPOV/Pictures/20080702-hardware-dc_dc.jpg here]:

And the schematic:

Two tests were made, using a RL of 100K and 47R to get ~50uA and 100mA respectively.

Here are the results on oscilloscope, with RL = 100k - channel 1 on Vout and channel 2 on positive side of schottky diode:
