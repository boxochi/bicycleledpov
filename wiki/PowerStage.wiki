=Power calculations=
==Vcc +5V==
The IC's that will be supplied with 5 volts are the MCU, the sensor hall effect and the serial EEPROM memory.

I estimate no more than 15mA for MCU, 5mA for sensor hall effect and 8mA for serial EEPROM memory -- total of 28mA. The DC-DC should be dimensioned for this 28mA.

==Vcc +2.4V==
LEDs will be drived with this voltage but with a resistor in series.

=Development and testing of a DC-DC converter=
On date 2 of July of 2008, JpCasainho assembled a DC-DC converter that boots his 2,4 volts at input to 5 volts at his output, with at least 100mA of current at output. JpCasainho had as reference the [http://www.ladyada.net/make/mintyboost/ Minty Boost] circuit.

The idea is to power with 5 volts the MCU, EEPROM memory and sensor hall effect, using just two `NiMh` cells in series - 2,4 volts.

Here is the DC-DC circuit at testing - high quality version [http://bicycleledpov.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/BicycleLEDPOV/Pictures/20080702-hardware-dc_dc.jpg here]:

And the schematic:

Two tests were made, using a RL of 100K and 47R to get ~50uA and 100mA respectively.

Here are the results on oscilloscope, with RL = 100k - channel 1 on Vout and channel 2 on positive side of schottky diode:
