#summary Summary of Donald Ziems

= Introduction =

Hello, I'm Donald Ziems.  I'm 19 years old and majoring in Electrical Engineering at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Campaign.

I'm still relatively new to the world of AVR and computer programming, so primarily what I hope to do is work on the schematic and PCB layout, though I will take a peek at the firmware every now and then.

I haven't done a whole lot with electronics so far, but if you want to check out some of my work, Make: made mention of me in their blog.  My website no longer exists in its previous form, but you can kind of get an idea of what I did from the article.
